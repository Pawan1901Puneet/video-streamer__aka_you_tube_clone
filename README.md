# video-streamer__aka_you_tube_clone

This is a self-learning Full stack Project. I developed a Video-streaming Web-app where the users can stream the uploaded videos and can upload their own.

# Stack
I used MERN Stack to build this application

# Insights
While Developing this application, I addressed major essential aspects required in any application:
1. Authentication - Firebase
2. Authorization - JWT
4. CSRF Protection
5. File Upload - Firebase

All in all, it was fun building this application as I learnt many new things on the way, that are of great knowledge and lay a solid foundation of any of the advance concepts used in a high-scale applications.
